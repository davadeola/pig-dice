## Rules of Pig Dice
* There are two players in a game of pig dice. They both enter their names and the first player is given a chance to roll
* Each player rotates turns
* During a round the player is given a random number from 1 to 6 which is produced by the computer
* If a player holds, the sum of the round is calculated and added to thae general score of each player
* However if a player rolls one before he/she holds, the round total is erased and nothing is added to the final score of the player and the  turn is passed to the next player
* The first player to reach a total score of 100 wins the game.
